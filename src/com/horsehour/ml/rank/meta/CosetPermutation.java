/**
 * <p>
 * CPS (Coset Permutation distance based Stagewise) model is a new probabilistic
 * model over permutations, which is defined with a coset-permutation distance,
 * and models the generation of a permutation as a stagewise process.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The CPS model has rich expressiveness and can therefore be used in versatile
 * applications, because many different permutation distances can be used to
 * induce the coset-permutation distance. The complexity of the CPS model is low
 * because of the stagewise decomposition of the permutation probability and the
 * efficient computation of most coset-permutation distances.
